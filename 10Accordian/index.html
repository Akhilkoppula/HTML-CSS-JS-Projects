                HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It structures the content of a webpage, telling browsers how to display text, images, and other elements. HTML is not a programming language but a markup language, meaning it uses tags to annotate text and define how it should be presented.

            <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Traditionally, JavaScript was limited to client-side web development within browsers. Node.js extends its capabilities to the server-side, enabling the development of back-end applications, APIs, and various other tools using JavaScript.</p>
